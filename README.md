#Jetpack Carousel Enhancements
This plugin removes the comment form from the Carousel screen, moves the metabox and image cation to the center of the screen and also moves the close hint to the top right part of the screen. Inspired by the big number of support tickets regarding these elements. Use at your own risk.
